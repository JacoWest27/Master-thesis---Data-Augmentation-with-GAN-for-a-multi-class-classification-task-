# Master-thesis---Data-Augmentation-with-GAN-for-a-multi-class-classification-task-
Data Augmentation with GAN  for a multi-class classification task in a Industry4.0 case of study

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##THIS FOLDER CONTAINS 3 DIFFERENT PRINCIPAL FOLDERS:

1) Colab Notebooks: 
- Contains lot of incremental tests performed with D.A. strategies with GAN and basic CV transformations.
- Contains lot of incremental tests performed with Adversarial Learning strategies e Bias Detection measures.

NOTE: The folder contains experiments executed both with Tensorflow and Pytorch frameworks.


2) TEST PYTORCH:
- Contains all the experiment results performed with the Pytorch framework, regarding D.A. strategies:
	a) Online D.A. ;
	b) Offline D.A. ;
	c) Offline D.A. with GAN ;
	
	
3) Various:
- Contains the CSV file with file Images labels and info.
- Some other various files (older experiments results, metric files).
